# LeViT-TensorRT
The goal of this project is to accelerate the deployment of __LeViT__ networks using __TensorRT__, including test results for FP16 and Int8.
## Overview
As the current visual Transformer with the fastest inference speed, LeViT is significantly better than the existing CNN and visual Transformer in terms of speed/accuracy trade-off, such as ViT, DeiT, etc., and the top-1 accuracy is 80%. Lower LeViT is 3.3 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. It has high application value in scenarios with limited computing power.

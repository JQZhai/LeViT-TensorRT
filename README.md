# LeViT-TensorRT
## Overview
As the current visual Transformer with the fastest inference speed, LeViT is significantly better than the existing CNN and visual Transformer in terms of speed/accuracy trade-off, such as ViT, DeiT, etc., and the top-1 accuracy is 80%. Lower LeViT is 3.3 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. It has high application value in scenarios with limited computing power.  
The goal of this project is to accelerate the deployment of LeViT networks using TensorRT, including test results for FP16 and Int8.
